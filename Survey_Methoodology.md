# Survey Design Rationale

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the methodological structure and strategic reasoning behind each module and question in the **Project EV Pulse Canada** survey. The survey is designed not as a simple poll, but as a diagnostic tool to capture a multi-layered understanding of consumer sentiment in the Canadian automotive market.

## Overall Structure: The Consideration Funnel

The survey is architected as a "consideration funnel," intentionally moving the respondent from broad, objective questions to more specific and psychological ones. This approach provides crucial context for interpreting the attitudinal data and ensures higher quality responses.

### Module A: Screener & Respondent Profile

**Objective:** To qualify relevant participants and gather essential data for segmentation.

* **Q1 (Purchase Intent):** The primary **gatekeeper question**. It filters for active vehicle shoppers to ensure data is commercially relevant and predictive of near-term market behavior.

* **Q2 (Province/Territory):** The core **segmentation variable**. The Canadian EV market is highly regional; this question is critical for analyzing the impact of local policies, infrastructure, and culture.

* **Q3 (Residence/Parking):** A reliable **proxy for home charging capability**. It objectively identifies a key logistical barrier without relying on the respondent's self-assessed "worry" about charging.

* **Q4 (Household Income):** Enables analysis of how **price sensitivity** and the importance of financial incentives vary across different economic strata.

### Module B: Current Vehicle & Usage Profile

**Objective:** To establish a baseline of the respondent's current transportation reality and daily needs.

* **Q5 (Current Vehicle):** Establishes baseline **brand loyalty** and **vehicle segment preference**. This data is crucial for measuring a brand's ability to convert its existing customer base to its EV offerings.

* **Q6 (Daily Driving Distance):** Directly tests **range anxiety vs. practical need**. It allows for a comparison between empirical daily use and a respondent's perception of an EV's range limitations.

* **Q7 (Long-Distance Trips):** Quantifies the **"edge case" problem**. This isolates and measures the prevalence of road trip anxiety, a common barrier cited even by those whose daily needs are met by EV range.

### Module C: EV Perceptions & Consideration

**Objective:** To measure core attitudes and beliefs about Electric Vehicles.

* **Q8 (Likelihood to Consider):** The primary **quantitative benchmark** for the study. It provides the key metric that can be tracked over time and compared against other industry studies.

* **Q9 (Open-Ended "Why?"):** The primary **qualitative data capture** for verbatim coding. This question is designed to elicit unfiltered, top-of-mind reasoning from the respondent.

* **Q10 (Agreement Matrix):** Systematically measures and quantifies attitudes across the most common themes (cost, range, infrastructure, etc.). The inclusion of a **"Don't Know"** option is a best practice to ensure data quality by filtering out uninformed responses.

* **Q11 (Brand Consideration):** Maps the current **competitive landscape** by identifying the specific brands in a consumer's active consideration set.

* **Q11b (Brand Attributes):** A dynamic follow-up that captures **brand perception**. It explains *why* certain brands are being considered (e.g., for innovation, reliability, or value), providing deeper strategic insights.

### Module D: The Purchase Journey & Influence

**Objective:** To understand the impact of firsthand experience on consumer perception.

* **Q12 (EV Experience):** Directly measures the **"experience gap,"** a known critical barrier. It quantifies the proportion of the market that has yet to have any firsthand interaction with an EV.

* **Q13 & Q14 (Conditional Follow-Ups):** **Diagnostic questions** that appear based on the answer to Q12. They probe the *impact* of a prior experience (Q13) or what it would take to *motivate* an experience (Q14).

### Module E: Policy, Incentives, & The Future

**Objective:** To measure the respondent's awareness of and reaction to real-world market factors.

* **Q15 (Rebate Awareness):** Gauges **awareness of a major market event**. It provides context on whether consumer cost perceptions are based on current or outdated information.

* **Q16 (Incentive Framing):** A **behavioral economics question** designed to isolate the psychological value of a rebate, separate from the net cost of the vehicle.

* **Q16b (TCO Trade-Off):** Forces a direct choice between upfront cost and long-term savings, providing a quantitative measure of a respondent's **Total Cost of Ownership** sensitivity.

* **Q17 (Reaction to Mandate):** A final qualitative question designed to capture the **emotional response** (e.g., pressure, acceptance, resentment) to government policy, providing rich data for verbatim analysis.
